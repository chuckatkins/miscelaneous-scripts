This is a colleciton of miscelaneous scripts that I happen to compe up with
and find useful.  Below is a brief summary of each.

As for licensing, I'm placing them all under the public domain.  This
basically means that you can do whatever you want with it.  If you happen to
find it useful though and want to use any of them in a project, I'd appreciate
a brief mention :-)
